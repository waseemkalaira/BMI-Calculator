# BMI-Calculator
The BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a simple tool used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. By inputting weight and height, it provides a BMI value that categorizes individuals into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity. This helps in understanding and managing one's health and fitness levels.
